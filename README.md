## ðŸ’Œ What I prepared for you

- `^w^` A **"Yes"** buttonâ€¦ just for you to tell me you want meâ€¦  
- `7w7` A **"No"** button that loves to play and escape from your clickâ€¦ and thereâ€™s no reason for you to click it `>w<` hahaha
- `>w0` Me floating, light and graceful, just to catch your attentionâ€¦  
- `<3` Hearts rising, just to hypnotize youâ€¦  
- `>w<` A little corner made especially for you to feel my presence.
